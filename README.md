# AUTO-ENCODER-NEURAL-NETWORK
IMPLEMENTED A FULLY-CONNECTED TWO-LAYER AUTO-ENCODER NEURAL NETWORK.

Implemented a fully-connected two-layer auto-encoder neural network and trained it using <b>mnist dataset</b> by varying the number of nodes in the hidden layer to accomplish the task of calculating and plotting <b>Mean Squared Error (MSE), Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Eigen Vectors.</b>

#### Implemented using Python and keras.
